# Voice Assistant

Developed with React Native, this voice assistant app receives voice commands from the user and processes these commands using ChatGPT's API. It provides an interactive experience by giving voice responses to the user. The Axios library was used for API requests, the react-native-responsive-screen library was used for a responsive design according to device screen sizes, and the react-native-community/voice library was used for voice input. Additionally, Tailwind is stylized with CSS.
